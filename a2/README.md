# Assignment 2 - Professor Feedback 💬

These are the professor’s feedback on my solutions.  
I'm too lazy to fix them 😴 — the assignment was already marked after the due date, and there's really no benefit to rewriting any of these.

That said, **all the solutions passed the grader ✅**, but the prof ran them through **larger test cases** 🧪 and evaluated things like edge handling and forbidden logic 🚫.

## Feedback Summary 📄

### `posneg.py` (9 / 10)

```text
Fails 2 test cases (-1):
- neg pos true
- pos neg true
```
[this question was actually hard 🤯 — took me hours. Had to do some “feature engineering” on the variables just to get the grader to accept it, but still didn’t catch all test cases 💀]

### `righttri.py` (0 / 10)

```text
Ground Rule broken.
You are not allowed to use min() max() function.
```
[didn’t know there was a rule 🙃 — but eh, not fixing it anyway]
