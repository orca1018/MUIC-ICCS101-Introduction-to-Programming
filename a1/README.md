# Assignment 1 - Professor Feedback ğŸ’¬

These are the professorâ€™s feedback on my solutions.  
I'm too lazy to fix them ğŸ˜´ â€” the assignment was already marked after the due date, and there's really no benefit to rewriting any of these.

That said, **all the solutions passed the grader âœ…**, but the prof ran them through **larger test cases** ğŸ§ª and evaluated things like edge handling and forbidden logic ğŸš«.
